    <h2><span>Introduction</span></h2>
    <p>Since college, I have been actively involved in LGBTQ+ rights and visibility, sexual education, and health rights advocacy. Over the last couple of years,
      I developed strong interests in bioethics, particularly technology and health-related issues and policies. I will use this channel here as a tool to practice 
      science and health policy analysis and build a platform to voice my opinion in treading bioethical and political issues.
