      <h2>Hi, I'm Huanan Shi.</h2>
      <p>I am a Ph.D. candidate within the Molecular Physiology and Biophysics program at Baylor College of Medicine. My dissertation work in Dr. David Durgan's lab integrates multi-omics approaches with machine learning algorithms to answer physiological questions. My research focuses on understanding the host-gut microbiome interaction and the roles of gut microbiota in cardiovascular diseases, such as hypertension. My implementation skills in Python and R and proficiency in research are backed up by many research projects and are applicable beyond lab research. I am a fast learner and enthusiastic about creativity and innovation. I work both independently and in interdisciplinary teams.
Beyond science, I am interested in bioethics, particularly technology and health-related issues and policies. I have been actively involved in LGBTQ+ rights and visibility, sexual education, and health rights advocacy.</p>
